This Project is about Sentiment Analysis.

This project is developed under Python and the machine learning model used for this project is Random Forest together with NLP (Natural Language Processing) to be able to determine either it is positive or negative sentiments.

The project also uses X api or formerly known as Twitter API to extract tweets and use that data to train our machine learning model.

This was used on our thesis during in our final years of college.
